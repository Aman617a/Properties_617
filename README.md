Properties_617

This project is a web application that allows users to search for rental properties across multiple platforms (OpenRent and RightMove) based on their location, price range, and number of rooms. The application fetches property listings, stores them in a database, and displays them on a results page. Users can also choose to receive the results via email in CSV format.
